title: apple pie
description: apple pie - ingredients and instructions
---

ingredients: flour, salt, butter, egg, lemon juice, apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice.

to bake from frozen: bake at 450°F for 15 minutes; then cover the pie loosely with foil (to prevent the crust from burning, especially at the edges), reduce temperature to 375°, and bake for another 45 minutes.

Note: I don't add sugar when I bake, so depending on your tastes this may be a good or bad thing. :) If you like your desserts sweeter, I recommend having this with caramel sauce, whipped cream, or ice cream.

Enjoy!
