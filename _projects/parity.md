title: error detection magic trick
description: Code to generate classroom handouts for an error detection lesson.
---

CS Unplugged has a [lesson on error detection](https://csunplugged.org/en/topics/error-detection-and-correction/unit-plan/parity-magic/) that uses secret parity bits to make a card trick work. 

I wanted to use this activity as part of a timed team event, so I wrote a script to generate grids of arbitrary size where the bottom row and right column of tiles are parity bits. I'll update this article with links to the code once I find it.

Here is a [handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzRY6G4ykffSLLlW3nJi1B3JH7Yq89mZWu-8ccc4dYA/preview) with sixteen grids ranging from 6x6 to 9x9 tiles.
