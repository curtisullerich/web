I perform as part of the Google Mobile Orchestra. We primarily use tether
controllers with Android tablets running
[MobMuPlat](http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/) and a custom synth designed
by Dan Iglesia, the GMOrk leader.  I also performed as a guest artist in
Sideband's Bay Area tour in fall of 2018.

### Haptic 3D Music
While at Iowa State University I was an RA and student of
[Dr. Christopher Hopkins](https://www.music.iastate.edu/people/christopher-hopkins),
PI of Virtual Environment Sound Control. I contributed work to the platform for
enabling dynamic manipulation of objects in haptic 3D space to spawn and move
objects using a stylus.  

#### A Walk
Darren Hushak and I created a piece within VESC, with control in Max/MSP and
sound design in Reaktor. This piece is all about textures and
[mappings](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1090000/1085207/p1-hunt.pdf?ip=65.110.254.40&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&CFID=251752148&CFTOKEN=87889625&__acm__=1357930181_e70cb6d6d87420859d3df035d906b669).
In Max/MSP we combined surface parameters like friction, with stylus interaction
parameters like force, orientation, and velocity using various mappings for
sound synthesis.

#### Euc-grid
I created a checkerboard-like layout and used my newly-written features of
object spawning and movement to control the x-y pair inputs to a
[Euclidean rhythm](http://www.hisschemoller.com/2011/euclidean-rhythms/)
generator.

### live coding
I've done some live coding in Impromptu and Extempore. Here is a piece I made
called "Bight"

### pitch trail composer
I made an application in Max/MSP that allows you to draw lines on a canvas and
play them back interpreted as glissandi in the time:pitch coordinates.

### pops
My very first music technology project. Using one 800 ms sample of a "pop"
sound, I created a single-timbred sampling instrument reminiscent of a marimba.
Using Audacity, I cleaned up the sample and pitch shifted to a three-octave set
of notes. This is a piece I wrote to display it, with tracking done in Pro
Tools.
