This page describes some of my work in computer music.

I perform as part of the Google Mobile Orchestra. We primarily use tether controllers with Android tablets running MobMuPlat and a custom synth designed by Dan Iglesia, the GMOrk leader. Videos of some of our performances are in this YouTube [playlist]().  

others:
electroacoustic compositions, haptic 3D music, kontakt scripting, pitch trail composer, rtcmix
