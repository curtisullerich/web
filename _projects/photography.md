Some of my favorite captures are in this Google Photos [album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/CMhgE6r7vy5XwQCT9).

<div class="col three caption">
  The Milky Way over Reflection Canyon in Utah. This was a 20-mile round trip to get to the vantage point, with our tents just meters from the tripod.

I enjoy doing astrophotography, primarily of the Milky Way. I combine this with camping and backpacking, sometimes with cool results in the backcountry. I like playing with long exposures, product (okay, food) photography, portraiture, and still life.
